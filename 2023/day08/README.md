# Day 8

Solution for part 2 works only, because the input is nice and all the paths cycle back to the start immediately after their respective target nodes. Otherwise one would need to find cycles for every potential target node, and the beginning of every such cycle and then the least common multiple for all such combinations... I think.

day8_ger: this is obviously meant to be a joke. ;)
