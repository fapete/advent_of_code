# Common utilities

Header files with utilities that can be useful when solving these puzzles. I'm trying to keep these generic, but generally only flesh them out, if I actually need them more than once.

Currently contains:

* Grid: Generic Grid and ActorGrid (grid with movable actors)
* Matrix: 2D Matrices, this one is currently *not* useable in general, but only works for the solution of one puzzle. It is very buggy in the current state.
