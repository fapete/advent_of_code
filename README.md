# Advent of Code

My solutions to the [advent of code](adventofcode.com) puzzles I have attempted so far. Not all (but most) of these are working solutions yet: if a solution is not complete, some details about what is missing are given in individual readmes.

Note that I don't usually refactor these after getting a solution. The code herein is often messy and written without maintenance in mind. I never work on one of these puzzles on a different day than the release day.
