# Day 19

Solution is for part 1 only and very slow (also, the code is, well, not good). Worked on my input, but at least on of the heuristics applied to prune the search space is incorrect in general. I haven't run it on part 2, it would take about an hour on my machine to compute a likely wrong result.
