# 2022

Yet another year, again using Haskell as I generally enjoyed it last year,
although I'd be significantly faster using a language that I know better. I'm
setting a 2-hour timer every day this year, and will stop working on the puzzle
if I don't finish it in that timeframe, to prevent a burn-out situation that I
ran into last year. 

Judging by experience from the previous years, this means I will not be solving
quite a few puzzles this time.
